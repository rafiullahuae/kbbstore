# Boot a preview of the flag bar for the Lane FB screenshots.
#
# Mirrors tools/bn-preview.sh and tools/hl-preview.sh, MINUS the two patches
# they carry: this lane adds no route file and no admin partial, so there is
# nothing for the integrator to wire and nothing for this script to fake. The
# copy under storage/ is the tracked tree exactly as it stands.
#
# It is still a THROWAWAY COPY rather than the worktree, for the reason those
# scripts give: the preview writes a database, uploads and compiled views, and
# a screenshot harness that leaves those behind in the tree is a harness that
# shows up in `git status` as a lane's work.
#
# vendor/ is symlinked rather than copied, so the copy costs nothing and the PHP
# classes it runs are this worktree's own.
#
# APP IS DERIVED FROM THIS SCRIPT'S OWN LOCATION, never hardcoded — two
# harnesses in this repository were unrunnable because their lane's worktree had
# been removed when its branch merged.

# ── THE PORT IS ASKED FOR, NOT GUESSED ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# This read `PORT=${1:-8978}` and used it without checking. Thirty-nine preview
# scripts share this repository and six of them defaulted to 8991, five to 8989
# and four to 8977, so two lanes colliding was not bad luck, it was the design.
#
# It fails in the way that costs the most: `php -S` prints "Address already in
# use" into its own log, the script reports a URL anyway, and the shot run that
# follows photographs WHOEVER IS ALREADY ON THAT PORT. Lane BG lost twenty
# minutes to exactly that -- a shop with the wrong catalogue in it and a 404 on
# a product that was certainly in the database -- and a leaked server outlives
# the run that started it, so the collision is permanent for everybody once it
# happens.
#
# tests/Support/PreviewPort.php is the same fix for the suite and carries the
# same story. Here it is: walk up from the requested port and take the first one
# that will actually bind.

# ── AND IT PROVES THE SERVER ANSWERING IS THE ONE THIS SCRIPT STARTED ───────

# A 200 is not enough. A dead bind leaves ANOTHER LANE's preview answering on
# this port, and that server returns 200 to everything -- so a run that checks
# only the status code goes on to photograph somebody else's shop and looks
# completely finished doing it. Lane PG2 caught this with a request for a slug
# only its own seed creates; this is the same idea made general, so that every
# script gets it whether or not it has a slug of its own to ask for.
#
# A nonce is written into THIS script's webroot and read back over HTTP. Another
# lane's server is rooted in another lane's directory, so it cannot have the
# file: the probe fails and the script refuses rather than handing back a URL.
