# adds no route and no admin screen, so the tracked application runs as it is.
#
# It serves a THROWAWAY COPY under storage/ so nothing here can leave a file in
# the checkout, and APP is derived from this script's own location rather than
# hardcoded, so the harness still runs from the branch after the worktree goes.
#
# tools/m1-router.php is the router and not `php -S` alone: php -S hands every
# /uploads/ request to index.php and a JPEG comes back as text/html, which is
# exactly a broken image in a screenshot and only ever the preview.

# ── THE PORT IS ASKED FOR, NOT GUESSED ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# This read `PORT=${1:-8977}` and used it without checking. Thirty-nine preview
# scripts share this repository and six of them defaulted to 8991, five to 8989
# and four to 8977, so two lanes colliding was not bad luck, it was the design.
#
# It fails in the way that costs the most: `php -S` prints "Address already in
# use" into its own log, the script reports a URL anyway, and the shot run that
# follows photographs WHOEVER IS ALREADY ON THAT PORT. Lane BG lost twenty
# minutes to exactly that -- a shop with the wrong catalogue in it and a 404 on
# a product that was certainly in the database -- and a leaked server outlives
# the run that started it, so the collision is permanent for everybody once it
# happens.
#
# tests/Support/PreviewPort.php is the same fix for the suite and carries the
# same story. Here it is: walk up from the requested port and take the first one
# that will actually bind.

# A 200 is not enough. A dead bind leaves ANOTHER LANE's preview answering on
# this port, and that server returns 200 to everything -- so a run that checks
# only the status code goes on to photograph somebody else's shop and looks
# completely finished doing it. Lane PG2 caught this with a request for a slug
# only its own seed creates; this is the same idea made general, so that every
# script gets it whether or not it has a slug of its own to ask for.
#
# A nonce is written into THIS script's webroot and read back over HTTP. Another
# lane's server is rooted in another lane's directory, so it cannot have the
# file: the probe fails and the script refuses rather than handing back a URL.
